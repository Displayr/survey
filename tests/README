api.R: Run example(api) to check that results haven't changed

caleg.R: Calibration examples
	 - calibration to information on PSUs rather than population
	 - check that bounded weights really are bounded
	 - check that linear calibration with error proportional to 
           x agrees with ratio estimators

check.R:  Many combinations of options for svydesign

domain.R: Check that domain estimators of means and their standard
          errors agree with derivations as ratio and regression 
          estimators.  Repeat for calibrated and raked designs

fpc.R: Many ways to specify fpc

lonely.psu.R: All the lonely PSU options

multistage.R: Check that a two-stage cluster sample analysis agrees with
              the hand-calcuated result in Sarndal et al.

quantile.R: quantile estimation on a lognormal sample

rakecheck.R: check that raking by iterative post-stratification agrees with
 	     raking using calibrate()

scoping.R: check that svyglm and svycoxph work inside functions.
