2.0

1.9-3  Fix svytotal variance estimate
       as.svrepdesign wasn't handling unstratified cluster samples right.
       Check for fpc in multistage samples.
       add print method for basic survey statistics
       add rake()
       California API data.

1.9-2	Added post-stratification of replicate-weights

1.9-1   Bugfix: jknweights was requiring finite population correction.

1.9 	- "certainty" option for single-PSU strata
        - Replication weight analyses (alpha version)

1.4	- I think all the possible permutations of arguments 
	in svydesign now work.
	- The examples in svyglm incorrectly had a data= argument.	

1.3	svydesign wasn't allowing weights to be a vector.

1.2  	- svydesign(nest=TRUE) now uses less memory
	- added regTermTest for testing regression terms.	

1.1   	Added subset, update methods.  Variance estimation is now correct for
 	subpopulations produced with select or subscripting.

1.0	No changes
	
0.9-5   - finite population correction should be done with PSUs not 
	  individuals
	- added Cox models

0.9-4	- svyCprod was computing n/(n-1) using number of observations, 
          not number of PSUs, and was averaging observations rather than 
 	  PSU means to compute stratum means. 
	- Bug in handling multiple levels of cluster id in svydesign

0.9-3:   Finite population correction.
 	 Adjustments for stratum with single PSU (Fred Rohde)
	 Fixed svydesign(nest=TRUE) to work with strata

0.9-1:	First release.
