 - Score-based confidence intervals for glms

 - More general HT estimator for sampling without replacement
 	- using joint inclusion probabilities
	- using population first-order inclusion probabilities
	- using Overton's approximation and sample inclusion probabilities

 - Calibration estimators
	- Poststratifying to a logistic model as for two-phase case-control
	  and marginal structural models
	- GREG estimators

 - Survival curve estimation (the standard errors are the only 
	non-trivial part of this)

 - Large data sets: design object with references to data stored in a 
   database. Probably no regression models.

 - GEE. 

 - Parametric survival models.
